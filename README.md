## About Me
My name is Devon Standingstrong and I'll be posting articles here on my blog as I study all things information security. My main interests include reverse engineering, cyber threat intelligence, IoT hacking, digital forensics, and video game hacking/cheating.

My journey has been a life-long one. I started "hacking" by messing with GBA games first then PS2 games. I attended community college and completed my A.A.S in Computer Forensics. Currently, I am completing my B.S in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at WGU.

You can find me competing in random CTFs under the gnNNer0x username.
